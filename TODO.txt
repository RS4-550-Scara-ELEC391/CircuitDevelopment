Make hbridge for linear actuator. Find a speed control circuit. Test optoisolator (I think it acts like a NOT
gate for some reason). Remove NOT gate, arduino high-low/low-high control direction, low-low stops arduino. Think of
protection that will set inputs to low-low if the input is high-high. Look into high current protection
